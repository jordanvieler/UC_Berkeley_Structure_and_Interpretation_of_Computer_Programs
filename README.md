# UCB SICP Fall 2020
## Labs, Homework and Projects from UC Berkeley, CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

  In order to deepen my understanding of python and computer programming, I decided to take the full Fall 2020 CS61A course taught by John DeNiro at UC Berkeley. 
The content of which is available [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/).

  I have been completing the assigned readings, discussion worksheets, labs, homework and projects. Additionally,
I have been watching all lectures and QAs, and taking the available midterms. To improve my learning, I have been using only course materials to solve difficult
problems.

   Interestingly, this iteration of the course was offered online/remote ONLY Fall 2020. Therefore, I believe I am having a similar learning experience to students 
who were formally enrolled in this 1500+ student course during the fall of 2020. 

The purpose of this repo is to showcase the work I have completed as part of this course.
