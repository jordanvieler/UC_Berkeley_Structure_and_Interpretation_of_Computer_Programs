# UCB SICP Fall 2020
## Labs, Homework and Projects from UC Berkeley, CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

  In order to deepen my understanding of python and computer programming, I decided to take the full [Fall 2020 CS61A](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa20/) course taught by John DeNiro at UC Berkeley. I elected to take this version of SICP over others because of the accesability of the content, modern relevance of python, and the fact that this course was offered online/remote ONLY Fall 2020. Therefore, I can be confident the online materials were available in full and tailored toward learning from home.

  I have been completing the assigned readings, discussion worksheets, labs, homework and projects. Additionally,
I have been watching all lectures and QAs, and taking the available midterms. To improve my learning, I have been using only course materials to solve difficult
problems.

  This repo contains the [homework](https://github.com/jordanvieler/UC_Berkeley_Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs/tree/main/Homework), [labs](https://github.com/jordanvieler/UC_Berkeley_Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs/tree/main/Labs), and [projects](https://github.com/jordanvieler/UC_Berkeley_Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs/tree/main/Projects) that I have completed as part of this course.
