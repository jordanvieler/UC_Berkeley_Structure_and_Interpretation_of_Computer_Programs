# Projects
- **Hog:** I completed the hog.py file which controls the logic for a dice game called hog. In Hog, two players take turns rolling dice and compete to be the first to achieve 100 points. There are special rules such as Pig Out, Free Bacon, Swine Align, and Pig Pass. I implemented the functionality for turn taking, a game announcer and strategies for a computer opponent.
- **Cats:** I completed the cats.py file which contains the logic for a typing race game called Cats. I implemented the logic for typing statistics, different autocorrect methods, and client-side multiplayer.
